In this message, you will find an example of a "ctx" object received by my telegram bot when a user sends a message that contains a video.
The information contained in it can be used to extrapolate the video's name.
The video can be an episode of a series or a movie.

If the video is a movie, I expect the title to be in the following format: "TITLE: Title_Of_The_Movie"
If the video is an episode of a series you must provide the title in the following format: 'TITLE: "Name_Of_The_Series_(episode_number)"'
If the video is an episode of a series you must provide also the series name in the following format: 'SERIES_NAME: "Name_Of_The_Series"'
If you find any suitable series name from the following list use it, otherwise include the new series name in your answer:
```
<%= seriesNames %>
```

If the caption includes additional instructions about how to name the video, follow them.

Always include the 'TITLE: ' prefix before the title of the video.
Always include the 'SERIES_NAME: ' prefix before the name of the series, if the video is an episode of a series.
 
This is the ctx object:
```
<%= ctxJson %>
```

Keep the answer short, and be sure to include the title of the video in the answer.
